Here's a sample `README.md` file you can use to describe how you cleaned and analyzed the customer dataset in **JupyterLab**. This assumes a basic level of preprocessing, cleaning, and some exploratory data analysis steps. You can customize or expand based on what you actually did:

# üßπ Customer Dataset Analysis & Cleaning in JupyterLab

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a customer dataset using **JupyterLab**. The dataset contains information on customer demographics, purchase behavior, shipping types, and more. The goal was to prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, converting data types, and exploring patterns that could provide business insights.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **2,005** rows and the following **11 columns**:

| Column              | Description                        | Data Type |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| CustomerID          | Unique ID for each customer        | `int64`   |
| Gender              | Gender of the customer             | `object`  |
| Age                 | Age of the customer                | `int64`   |
| Items Purchased     | Items bought by the customer       | `object`  |
| Category            | Category of the items purchased    | `object`  |
| Purchase Amount     | Total purchase amount              | `int64`   |
| Shipping Type       | Shipping method chosen             | `object`  |
| Profession          | Profession of the customer         | `object`  |
| Subscription Status | Whether the customer is subscribed | `object`  |
| Season              | Season of the purchase             | `object`  |
| Country             | Customer‚Äôs country                 | `object`  |

## üßΩ Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Checked for Null Values:**

   * `Profession` and `Season` had missing values.
   * Used `df.isnull().sum()` to identify missing entries.

2. **Handling Missing Data:**

   * `Profession`: Filled missing values using the mode (most frequent profession).
   * `Season`: Imputed missing values based on the mode or inferred from purchase patterns (e.g., month, if available).

3. **Data Type Checks:**

   * Ensured that `Purchase Amount` and `Age` remained numeric.
   * Confirmed categorical features like `Gender`, `Shipping Type`, and `Subscription Status` were correctly typed.

4. **Standardized Text Columns:**

   * Converted all text fields to lowercase for consistency.
   * Stripped leading/trailing whitespace.

5. **Removed Duplicates (if any):**

   * Used `df.duplicated().sum()` and `df.drop_duplicates()`.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed basic EDA to understand customer behavior:

* **Demographics:**

  * Gender and age distribution.
  * Profession frequency counts.

* **Purchasing Behavior:**

  * Most common items purchased and categories.
  * Average purchase amount by age, gender, profession, and season.

* **Shipping & Subscription Trends:**

  * Correlation between shipping type and purchase amount.
  * Subscription status vs. purchase frequency.

* **Country-wise Distribution:**

  * Grouped data by `Country` to find top spending regions.

## üõ† Tools Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **NumPy** for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations
* **JupyterLab** for interactive analysis


## üìå Future Improvements

* Add time-based analysis if timestamps are available.
* Build customer segmentation models.
* Integrate with marketing data for predictive insights.
